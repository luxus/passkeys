# Features

Passkeys and the WebAuthn API are quite complex. We've taken an opinionated approach to the implementation and feature set to simplify things for you. Following the 80/20 principle we've tried to focus on the features most valuable to developers and users. We welcome feature requests so do [get in touch][contact].

1. **☝🏻 Biometrics** - We've made it really easy to implement facial or fingerprint recognition in your webapps.

2. **🔐 Step up authentication** - Require biometric or PIN verification for some actions e.g. changing account details, whilst allowing frictionless authentication for others.

3. **✉️ Mailbox verification** - Passlock also handles mailbox verification emails (which are more complex than you might think!)

3. **🖥️ Full management console** - Manage all security related aspects of your userbase through a web base console.

5. **🕵️ Audit trail** - View a full audit trail for each user: when they add a new passkey, when they login, verify their email address and much more.
